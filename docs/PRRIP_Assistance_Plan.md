# Proposed Plan for Further Assistance with PRRIP Architecture

This document outlines the plan for providing architectural assistance for the Pearl River Resort Integration Platform (PRRIP).

## 1. Deep Dive into Specific Services:
*   Read and analyze documentation for key logical services (e.g., [`data-access.markdoc`](docs/services/data-access.markdoc:0), [`messaging.markdoc`](docs/services/messaging.markdoc:0), [`api.markdoc`](docs/services/api.markdoc:0)).
*   Summarize findings and identify inter-dependencies.

## 2. Elaborate on Core Architectural Aspects:
*   Review and discuss sections from [`docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.markdoc`](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.markdoc:0) such as:
    *   Deployment Strategy (Local, Kubernetes, Azure).
    *   Observability Strategy (Logging, Metrics, Error Tracking).
    *   CI/CD Pipeline (GitLab CI, Future Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions).

## 3. System Diagramming and Visualization:
*   Generate or refine Mermaid diagrams for:
    *   Overall system data flows.
    *   Specific user interaction workflows.
    *   Component interaction models.
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        subgraph "User Interaction"
            User --> WebApp
        end
        subgraph "PRRIP Core (Remix)"
            WebApp -- Request --> AppShell
            AppShell --> APIService[API Component]
            AppShell --> DataAccessComponent[Data Access]
            AppShell --> CachingComponent[Caching]
            AppShell --> MessagingComponent[Messaging]
        end
        subgraph "Backend Services"
            DataAccessComponent --> Database[(PostgreSQL)]
            CachingComponent --> RedisCache[(Redis)]
            MessagingComponent --> MessageQueue[(RabbitMQ)]
        end
        APIService --> DataAccessComponent
    ```

## 4. Identify Potential Challenges and Considerations:
*   Brainstorm potential scalability bottlenecks.
*   Discuss security considerations for APIs and data.
*   Review fault tolerance and disaster recovery aspects.

## 5. Documentation Support:
*   Assist in drafting new Markdoc documentation for undocumented components.
*   Help review and refine existing architectural documents for clarity and completeness.
*   Ensure consistency across documentation.
