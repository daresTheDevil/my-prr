# Logical Component: Documentation

## Overview

The "Documentation" component within the PRRIP's consolidated Remix application is responsible for creating, managing, and rendering the platform's technical and user documentation. The Epic Stack often includes or suggests using Markdoc for this purpose, allowing documentation to be written in Markdown with enhanced features.

## Responsibilities

*   **Content Creation:** Writing and maintaining documentation content, including:
    *   System architecture (like the documents currently being created).
    *   API reference.
    *   Guides for developers (setup, contributing, style guides).
    *   User manuals for front-end application features.
    *   Operational procedures.
    *   Decision records.
*   **Content Management:** Organizing documentation files within the project structure.
*   **Rendering:** Using Markdoc (or a similar Markdown processing pipeline) to transform Markdown files into HTML pages that can be served by the Remix application.
*   **Navigation & Search:** Providing a user-friendly navigation structure and potentially search functionality for the documentation site.
*   **Versioning (Optional):** If needed, managing different versions of the documentation corresponding to different versions of the platform.
*   **Integration with App Shell:** The documentation site is typically a part of the main Remix application, served under a specific route (e.g., `/docs`).

## Key Technologies

*   **Markdoc:** A Markdown-based authoring framework that can add custom tags, partials, and other features to extend Markdown. (The Epic Stack has examples or can be easily integrated with it).
*   **Remix.run:** Serves the rendered HTML documentation pages.
*   **Markdown:** The primary format for writing documentation content.
*   **TypeScript/Node.js:** For any server-side logic related to fetching, parsing, or rendering Markdoc files.
*   **React:** For creating custom components that might be used within Markdoc (if Markdoc is configured to support them) or for the overall layout of the documentation site.

## Interactions

*   **`app-shell`:**
    *   Defines routes for the documentation site (e.g., `app/routes/docs/**.tsx`).
    *   Remix loaders fetch Markdoc files from the filesystem, parse them, and pass the content to React components for rendering.
*   **Development Team:** Writes and updates documentation content in Markdown files.
*   **Users (Developers, End-Users):** Access and read the documentation via their web browser.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Ensures documentation files are included in builds.
    *   Could potentially include steps to validate documentation (e.g., link checking, linting Markdown).
    *   Could automatically publish documentation updates upon deployment.

## Structure (Conceptual within `packages/core-app/`)

*   `docs/` (Project Root Level): This is where the raw Markdown source files for architecture, services (like this one), and other high-level docs are stored.
*   `packages/core-app/app/routes/docs/`: Remix routes for rendering the documentation.
*   `packages/core-app/content/docs/` (or similar): If Markdoc source files specifically for the *rendered documentation site* are kept separate from the project-level `docs/` directory. This might contain user guides, API references formatted for Markdoc, etc.
*   `packages/core-app/lib/markdoc.server.ts` (or similar): Utilities for parsing and transforming Markdoc content.
*   `packages/core-app/components/docs/`: Custom React components used in the layout or rendering of documentation pages.

## Workflow

1.  Developers write or update documentation in `.md` or `.markdoc` files.
2.  These files are committed to the Git repository.
3.  When a user navigates to a documentation page:
    *   The corresponding Remix loader fetches the Markdoc file.
    *   The Markdoc content is parsed and transformed into a renderable structure (e.g., an AST or HTML).
    *   The data is passed to a React component, which renders the final HTML.

## Notes

*   Keeping documentation within the same repository as the code ("Docs as Code") makes it easier to keep it up-to-date with changes in the application.
*   A good documentation site significantly improves the onboarding experience for new developers and the usability of the platform for end-users.
*   Consider a clear information architecture for the documentation to make it easy to navigate.
*   Automated checks (e.g., for broken links) can help maintain documentation quality.
