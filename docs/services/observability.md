# Logical Component: Observability

## Overview

The "Observability" component within the PRRIP's consolidated Remix application is responsible for providing insights into the application's behavior, performance, and health. This includes error tracking, logging, metrics collection, and potentially distributed tracing. The Epic Stack provides a foundation for this with Sentry integration.

## Responsibilities

*   **Error Tracking:** Capture and report unhandled exceptions and errors occurring anywhere in the application (front-end and back-end).
*   **Logging:** Implement structured logging for significant events, requests, business operations, and diagnostic information.
*   **Metrics Collection:** Gather key performance indicators (KPIs) and operational metrics, such as request rates, response times, error rates, resource utilization, and queue lengths.
*   **Alerting:** Configure alerts based on error thresholds, critical log patterns, or metric anomalies to notify the development team (e.g., via email, MS Teams).
*   **Dashboarding & Visualization:** Provide ways to view and analyze collected logs, metrics, and error data (e.g., via Sentry UI, Kibana, Grafana, Azure Monitor dashboards, or custom dashboards within PRRIP).
*   **Health Checks:** Expose health check endpoints that monitoring systems can use to verify the application's status.
*   **Distributed Tracing (Future Consideration):** As the system grows or if performance analysis requires it, implement distributed tracing to track requests across different logical parts of the application and even to external systems.

## Key Technologies

*   **Sentry:** (Integrated via Epic Stack) for error tracking, performance monitoring, and release health.
*   **Node.js Logging Libraries:** A structured logging library like `Pino` or `Winston` for server-side logging.
*   **Browser Console & Sentry:** For client-side logging and error reporting.
*   **Metrics Libraries (Optional):** Libraries like `prom-client` if exposing Prometheus-compatible metrics, or direct integration with cloud provider monitoring (e.g., Azure Monitor).
*   **Alerting Platforms:** Sentry's built-in alerting, or integration with external alerting systems based on logs/metrics.
*   **Visualization Tools:** Sentry UI, potentially ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logs, Grafana for metrics, or Azure Monitor.

## Interactions

*   **All Other Logical Components (`app-shell`, `data-access`, `caching`, `messaging`, `data-processing`, `api`, `integration`):** All components will generate logs, report errors to Sentry, and potentially emit metrics.
*   **Sentry Service:** The application sends error and performance data to Sentry.
*   **Logging Backend (e.g., ELK, Azure Log Analytics, stdout/stderr in containers):** Structured logs are sent to a central aggregation system or output for collection by container orchestration platforms.
*   **Metrics Backend (e.g., Prometheus, Azure Monitor):** Metrics are scraped or pushed to a monitoring system.
*   **Alerting System:** Receives triggers from Sentry, logging, or metrics systems to send notifications.
*   **Development Team:** Consumes dashboards, views logs, and receives alerts to monitor application health and troubleshoot issues.

## Structure (Conceptual within `packages/core-app/`)

*   **Sentry Initialization:**
    *   `app/entry.client.tsx`: Sentry initialization for the browser.
    *   `app/entry.server.tsx`: Sentry initialization for the server.
*   **Logging Configuration:**
    *   `app/lib/logger.server.ts` (or similar): Configuration and instantiation of the chosen structured logging library.
    *   Throughout the server-side code (`.server.ts` files), import and use the logger.
*   **Health Check Endpoint:**
    *   `app/routes/healthcheck.ts` (or similar): A Remix resource route that performs basic checks (e.g., database connectivity) and returns a status.
*   **Metrics Collection Points:** Embedded within relevant application logic (e.g., incrementing a counter after a successful API request).

## Design Considerations

*   **Structured Logging:** Use structured logs (e.g., JSON format) with consistent fields (timestamp, level, message, context) to make them easily searchable and analyzable.
*   **Log Levels:** Implement appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) and make them configurable per environment.
*   **Sensitive Data:** Be extremely careful not to log sensitive information (passwords, API keys, personal data). Implement sanitization.
*   **Actionable Alerts:** Configure alerts to be actionable and avoid alert fatigue.
*   **Correlation:** Use correlation IDs (e.g., a unique ID per request) to trace a single operation through different logs and components. Sentry often handles this for errors.
*   **Performance Impact:** Be mindful of the performance impact of extensive logging or metrics collection, especially in hot paths.

## Notes

Effective observability is crucial for maintaining a healthy and reliable application. It enables proactive issue detection, faster troubleshooting, and a better understanding of how the system is being used. The Epic Stack provides a good starting point with Sentry, which can be augmented with more comprehensive logging and metrics strategies.
